# Progress

## What Works
- **ProductWebAPI**: Basic CRUD (getall) and Consul registration.
- **CartWebAPI**: Cart management, Consul discovery, and Polly integration.
- **Gateway**: Ocelot routing to Product and Cart services.
- **Service Discovery**: Consul integration via Steeltoe.
- **Documentation**: `README.md` is accurate and includes all components.
- **Containerization**: Dockerfiles for all services with optimized multi-stage builds.

## What's Left to Build
- More robust error handling in services.
- Integration tests for the gateway and services.

## Current Status
