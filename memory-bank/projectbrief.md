# Project Brief: MicroserviceDemo

A demonstration of microservices architecture built with .NET 10.0, showcasing service discovery, resilience patterns, and communication using Consul, Steeltoe, Polly, and Minimal APIs.

## Core Requirements
- Implement microservices using .NET 10.0 Minimal APIs.
- Use Consul for service discovery.
- Use Steeltoe for Consul integration.
- Use Polly for resilience (Retry and Timeout policies).
- Implement an API Gateway using Ocelot.
- Use Entity Framework Core with In-Memory database for data persistence.

## Goals
- Demonstrate service-to-service communication via service discovery.
- Show how to handle transient failures using Polly.
- Provide a unified entry point for clients via an API Gateway.
